Two years ago, the Xen Project introduced [Unikraft](http://unikraft.org) as an
incubation project. Over the past two years, the Unikraft project has seen some
great momentum. Since the last release, the community has grown about 20% and
contributions have diversified a great deal. Contributions from outside the
project founders (NEC) now make up 63% of all contributions, up from about 25%
this time last year! In addition, a total of 56739 lines were added since the
last release (0.3).

As a quick primer, Unikraft provides an easier way to build unikernels,
compiling source code into a lean operating system that includes functionality
specifically tailored to the needs of the application logic. Unikernels, being
ultra-lightweight and small, are ideal for not just cloud applications (Unikraft
supports deployment on AWS, GCP and Digital Ocean) but also for fields where
resources may be constrained or safety is critical. In fact, Unikraft is not
only able to produce extremely efficient virtual machines, but in ongoing work
also specialized OCI/Docker containers and even bare metal ARM64 images ideally
suited for IoT and embedded devices. On a Raspberry Pi 3 B+, for example,
Unikraft is able to boot in under 10 milliseconds.

Over the past two years, the Unikraft team has made great progress in
simplifying the process of building unikernels through a unified and
customizable code base. Unikraft has seen a major increase in features and
functionality since the last release. Some of the notable additions for this
release (`0.4 Rhea`) are:

* Cloud-based deployments (GCP, AWS, Digital Ocean)
* Native support for many programming languages and language environments: C++, Python/Micropython, Go, Lua, Web Assembly (WAMR), JavaScript (Duktape), Ruby
* Improvements to the ARM64 platform, including virtio and multi-thread support
* Basic musl support
* pthread and TLS support
* Trace point sub-system
* Filesystem support (9pfs, devfs, ramfs)
* Applications: Click, SQLite, nginx, redis
* Support for external platforms, and in particular solo5
* Additional lib ports: uuid, http-parser, intel-intrinsics, openssl, boost, protobuf, etc.
* Lots of other features and bug fixes

In addition, with this release we’re introducing the `kraft` tool which greatly
simplifies the process of building and running Unikraft-built unikernels; check
it out [here](https://github.com/unikraft/kraft) (a special thank you goes to
Alexander Jung and Mujahid Ali for creating this tool).

contributed and continue to contribute to this project; below are the

Beyond the features of this `0.4 Rhea` release, we are excited to give
you a sneak peak into the features that are likely to make it into the
next release:

* Additional external platform support (e.g., Amazon Firecracker)
* Bare metal support (ARM64/Raspberry Pi and others)
* OCI/Docker support: have Unikraft generate extremely specialized containers
* Binary compatibility: run unmodified Linux ELFs directly on Unikraft

Finally, the Unikraft team's Simon Kuenzer recently gave a talk at
FOSDEM titled [Unikraft: A Unikernel Toolkit](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/uk_unicraft/). Simon, a senior systems
researcher at NEC Labs and the lead maintainer of Unikraft, spoke all
about Unikraft and provided a comprehensive overview of the project,
where it’s been and what’s in store.
