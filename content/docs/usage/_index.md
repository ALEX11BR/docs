## Using Unikraft

Generally speaking, Unikraft a library Operating System (libOS) and suite of
build tools.  To get started using Unikraft, you will need to use these tools
and relevant-to-your-usecase libOS microlibraries in order to construct a
Unikraft unikernel image.

The next sections will guide you on installing these tools and then approaching
building a unikernel as an application developer.  The tutorials are high-level
but include steps necessary to construct unikernels simply and easily.
