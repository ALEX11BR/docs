title: Running unikernels locally
description: |
  Built in to `kraft` is a runtime manager which allows you to instantiate and
  manage multiple unikernel instances locally.
---

<Info>
At present, `kraft` only supports running instances that target the KVM
hypervisor either through QEMU or Firecracker.  We plan on adding support for
additional hypervisors including Xen, VMWare and HyperV.  For more information
the progress of these hypervisors, you can [track the relevant GitHub issue](#).
</Info>

There are multiple ways to instantiate a unikernel with `kraft`.  The subcommand
`kraft run` has been designed to be context-aware and can be used in different
ways to launch unikernels depending on what is provided to it.

With the `kraft run` command, you are able to launch an instance using an
underlying hypervisor solution.  For example, `kraft run` will interface with
QEMU directly to instantiate a unikernel.

In some circumstances, for example in nested virtualization environments, it may
not be possible to access hardware-level instruction sets (ISAs) to execute the
unikernel.  In this scenario, hardware emulation will be used and it should be
noted that this has a significant penalty on runtime performance of the
application.


## Running after building a project

[Following a successful build of a unikernel](/docs/cli/building), you can
simply invoke the following without any additional flags when `cd`'d within a
project directory to preview the unikernel instance in action:

```bash
kraft run
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={12} src="/asciinema/kraft-run-project.cast" />

<Warning>
For long-running applications, typing <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> will only
detach you from the application's stdout.  See more about [stopping and removing
the unikernel instance](#stopping-and-removing-unikernel-instances).
</Warning>

In the above example, the [offical "Hello, world"
application](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld) was run.  It has
multiple targets with varying platforms and architecture tuples.  When `kraft
run` was invoked, it intelligently detected information about the host system
and suggested two possible targets based on the availability of QEMU on the
system.


## Running a Unikraft kernel binary image

It is possible to pass directly to `kraft run` in its first positional argument
the path to a binary image.  In the example below, we execute a pre-built
unikernel binary:

```bash
kraft run KERNEL
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={12} src="/asciinema/kraft-run-kernel.cast" />

In the above example, the provided kernel matched the host's architecture.
`kraft` will attempt to intelligently determine whether it can run the supplied
unikernel binary and select the appropriate hypervisor.


## Running a Linux userspace application (via a loader)

Given a pre-built Linux userspace application, it is possible to execute this on
top of Unikraft's [ELF Loader
Application](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader) in [binary compatibility
mode](/docs/concepts/compatibility).

```bash
kraft run BINARY
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-run-elfloader.cast" />

In the above example, a pre-built ELF Loader application was dynamically
downloaded and used to launch the pre-built `helloworld` binary.

You can set the path to the ELF Loader application, either as [an OCI Image
reference](/docs/cli/packaging#oci-based-package) or to a path on disk to a
kernel image via the `--elfloader` flag.  For example, we provide an
`strace`-like image which is packaged as an OCI image and available publicly at
`loaders.unikraft.org/strace:latest` which is useful for debugging:

```bash
kraft run --elfloader loaders.unikraft.org/strace:latest BINARY
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-run-elfloader-strace.cast" />


## Running pre-built OCI-packaged images

You can reference an [OCI image
unikernel](/docs/cli/packaging#oci-based-package) as a positional argument with
`kraft run` which, if not present on the host machine, will be downloaded before
it is executed. For example, to build an execute the official "Hello, world!"
application from Unikraft, you can run:

```bash
kraft run unikraft.org/helloworld:latest
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={12} src="/asciinema/kraft-run-oci-helloworld.cast" />


## Connecting a unikernel instance to a network

In most cases, applications are intended to be accessible over a network.
Built-in to `kraft` is a network manager which allows you to create, modify and
remove networks of varying implementation types.

<Info>
At present, `kraft` only supports networks on Linux based on bridge networking.
</Info>

To view existing networks, simply run:

```
kraft net ls
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={10} src="/asciinema/kraft-net-ls.cast" />

To create a new network, specify the address and range in CIDR notation with the
`-n` flag and a first positional argument representing the new network name:

```
kraft net create -n 172.88.0.1/24 kraft0
```

The first address in the CIDR network will become the gateway.  Once a network
has been identified, you can attach this network to the unikernel instance with
the `-n|--network` flag:

```
kraft run --network bridge:kraft0 unikraft.org/nginx:latest
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-run-network.cast" />

In the above command, the `--network` flag requires both the underlying driver
implementation name, `driver`, as well as the name of the network supported by
the driver, in this case `kraft0`, separated by a colon `:`.


## Forwarding exposed ports to your host

Whilst `-n|--network` allows you to connect multiple unikernels to the same
network, it can be also useful to simply port-forward from your host to a
unikernel instance.

For example, when an NGINX unikernel exposes port `80` and you wish to map port
`8080` on your localhost.  You can use the `-p` flag to achieve this affect as
follows:

```
kraft run -p 8080:80 unikraft.org/nginx:latest
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-run-port.cast" />

In the above example, the NGINX instance will be available at
http://localhost:8080/.

## Using initramfs vs. a mounted volume

Since we are building and running virtual machines, we can seed the root
filesystem with an [initial ramdisk
(initramfs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk).  This provides the
unikernel instance with an in-memory filesystem mounted at the root `/`.

The initramfs can be provided as a [CPIO
archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpio) or as a path to a directory which
will automatically be serialized into a CPIO archive.

<Warning>
To use an initramfs in your unikernel, you must build it with the following
additional KConfig options set in your `Kraftfile`:
```yaml
unikraft:
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_ROOTFS: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS_INITRD: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS: "initrd"
```
</Warning>

To set an initramfs file, you can use the `-i|--initrd` flag like so, setting it
either to a CPIO archive file:

```bash
kraft run -i ./rootfs.cpio unikraft.org/nginx:latest
```

Or you can pass a directory which will automatically be serialized into a CPIO
archive file:

```bash
kraft run -i ./rootfs unikraft.org/nginx:latest
```

<Info>
Note that when supplying a path to a directory, the directory is serialized
on-the-fly and the contents become read-only such that changes to this directory
on the host during the runtime of the unikernel will not be updated.
</Info>

In circumstances where you would like to make modifications to a filesystem
during the runtime of a unikernel instance, you must instead mount these using
the `-v|--volume` flag.  Mounting a volume to a unikernel instance done using
different underlying implementations.  The most common driver is [a 9PFS
filesystem](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/9pfs/README.md)
which allows for bi-directional communication via path mapping between the host
and the unikernel instance.  This is useful in circumstances where you wish to
make changes to a directory on your host which are represented live in the
unikernel instance.

<Warning>
To use bi-directional volumes on your unikernel instance, you must enable 9PFS
filesystem and build it with the following additional KConfig options set in
your `Kraftfile`:
```yaml
unikraft:
  kconfig:
  CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_ROOTFS: "y"
  CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS_9PFS: "y"
```
</Warning>

To use volume mounts in your unikernel, the `-v|--volume` flag accepts the
source directory mapped to a path in the unikernel separated by a colon `:`
delimiter, like so:

```bash
kraft run -v ./rootfs:/ unikraft.org/nginx:latest
```

In the above example, relative directory `./rootfs` is mapped to the root of the
unikernel instance located at `/`.

It is possible to mix-and-match or provide sub-paths by using multiple volumes,
for example, supplying an initial root filesystem as a CPIO archive and then
mounting only a sub-directory where you would like to see changes at runtime:

```bash
kraft run -i ./rootfs.cpio -v ./html:/nginx/html unikraft.org/nginx:latest
```

In the above example, an initial ramdisk is provided which supplies the
unikernel with a root filesystem provided by the CPIO archive in the relative
path `./rootfs.cpio` and we "overwrite" the contents in this filesystem at
`/nginx/html` with the contents on the host at the relative directory at
`./html`.  This allows you to dynamically change the served content by the NGINX
instance.

<Info>
Using pre-built unikernels [which are packaged as OCI
images](/docs/cli/packaging#oci-based-packages) may come with a ready made
initramfs which will automatically set a root filesystem.  This means that you
may wish to only set a volume to "overwrite" a particular directory with the
contents you wish to modify.  For example, with the NGINX image example supplied
above, you need simply to run the following to incur dynamic changes to the
served content:

```bash
kraft run -v ./html:/nginx/html unikraft.org/nginx:latest
```
</Info>


## Supplying command-line arguments

The unikernel instance essentially has two types of command-lines:

1. Arguments which are supplied directly to Unikraft's core.  These manipulate
   Unikraft itself and are used by kernel subsystems.  For example, these
   include: environmental variables; statically defined networking parameters
   such as IP address and gateway; and, named volumes and their intended mount
   paths.
2. Application-level command line arguments.  These are intended for the
   application which is built as a unikernel, for example with NGINX this could
   be the `-c` flag which sets the path in the root filesystem to the
   configuration file.


To set command-line arguments for either Unikraft or the application is done as
the second positional argument to `kraft run` or via the `-a` flag:

```bash
kraft run unikraft.org/nginx:latest -c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```

To set command-line arguments for Unikraft, you simply need to separate with two
dashes as a delimeter `--`, for example:

```bash
kraft run unikraft.org/nginx:latest netdev.ipv4_addr=172.88.0.2 -- -c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```


## Viewing unikernel instances

To view the state of previously instantiated unikernel instances you can use the
following:

```bash
kraft ps
```
```txt nocopy=true
NAME                KERNEL                           ARGS  CREATED      STATUS   MEM  PLAT
beautiful_bintijua  project://helloworld                   1 hour ago   exited   64M  qemu/x86_64
elastic_guy         oci://unikraft.org/nginx:latest        2 hours ago  running  64M  qemu/x86_64
```

The above command will display a `ps`-like output which displays the name, the
"source" of the unikernel (whether from [a project
context](#running-after-building-a-project), a [binary
context](#running-a-unikraft-kernel-binary-image), an [ELF Loader
context](#running-a-linux-userspace-application-via-a-loader) or an [OCI image
context](#running-pre-built-oci-packaged-images)), any command-line arguments
supplied to it, when it was created, its state, how much memory was assigned to
the instance, and which platform/architecture it is.

To view more detailed information about all instances, supply the `--long` flag:

```bash
kraft ps --long
```

Possible states of a unikernel instance are:

| State        | Description                                                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unknown`    | The instance's state could not be determined.                     |
| `created`    | The instance has been created but not started.                    |
| `failed`     | The instance could not be created.                                |
| `restarting` | The instance is in the process of rebooting.                      |
| `running`    | The instance is active and executing.                             |
| `paused`     | The instance has been paused and is no longer executing.          |
| `exited`     | The instance has gracefully exited (whether successful or not.)   |
| `errored`    | The instance has non-gracefully exited, e.g. crashed or panicked. |


## Stopping and removing unikernel instances

To stop an instance that is actively executing, you simply need to reference its
name which was either automatically generated or set via the `-n|--name` flag:

```bash
kraft stop NAME
```

To stop all actively executing instances, you can simply pass the `--all` flag:

```bash
kraft stop --all
```

To remove a specific instance:

```bash
kraft rm NAME
```

And to remove all instances, similarly pass the `--all` flag:

```bash
kraft rm --all
```

<Info>
Running `kraft rm` will gracefully stop the unikernel instance(s) before it is
removed.
