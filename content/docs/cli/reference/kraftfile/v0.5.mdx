title: Kraftfile Reference (v0.5)
description: |
  This document contains information about how to write a `Kraftfile` which is
  used to configure, build and package your application as a Unikraft unikernel.
---

<Warning>
**This document does NOT contain the latest `Kraftfile` specification
information**, please [refer to this document for the
latest](/docs/cli/reference/kraftfile/latest) information.
</Warning>

The `Kraftfile` is the static configuration file used to programmatically build
and package a unikernel using `kraft`.  This file contains information about the
Unikraft core build system, third-party libraries, all configuration options
which are used for the build and a list of possible targets for the application.
A `Kraftfile` is typically found at the top-level of a repository.  It is
possible to change this location with additional flags found in `kraft`.

The `Kraftfile` acts as the initialization for the configuration of the
unikernel, including the source location of the Unikraft core and any auxiliary
third-party libraries that are necessary for your application (e.g. OpenSSL).

## File names

For legacy reasons, the following file names are recognized by `kraft` where
`Kraftfile` is the latest preferred name:

* `Kraftfile`
* `kraft.yaml`
* `kraft.yml`

## Top-level `specification` and `name` attributes

All `Kraftfile`s MUST include a top-level `specification` attribute which is
used by `kraft` to both validate as well as correctly parse the rest of the
file. The latest specification number is `v0.5`:

```yaml
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld
```

Finally, an application `name` CAN specified.  When no `name` attribute is
specified, the directory's base name is used as the name.

## Top-level `unikraft` attribute

The `unikraft` attribute MUST be specified and is used to define the source
location of the [Unikraft core](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft) which
contains the main build system and core primitives for connecting your
application as well as any third-party libraries or drivers.

In all cases, there are two forms of syntax that can be used in the `Kraftfile`,
known as "short-hand" and "long-hand" depending on preference.


### Setting a specific version

The attribute can be specified in multiple ways, the most common is simply to
request the latest from a "stable" channel of Unikraft, e.g.:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-10}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

# Short-hand syntax
unikraft: stable

# Long-hand syntax
unikraft:
  version: stable
```

<Info>
The Unikraft project adopts two-channel release mode via `stable` and `staging`.
Specifying the latter will provide to you bleeding-edge version of Unikraft.
</Info>

To specify a specific version of Unikraft, including a specific Git commit, you
simply set it as follows:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-10,12-13,15-17}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

# Short-hand for a specific version of Unikraft
unikraft: v0.14.0

# Long-hand for a specific version of Unikraft
unikraft:
  version: v0.14.0

# Short-hand for a specific commit of Unikraft
unikraft: 70bc0af

# Long-hand for a specific commit of Unikraft
unikraft:
  version: 70bc0af
```


### Setting a specific source location

If you wish to use a copy of the Unikraft core code which is a remote fork or
mirror, it is possible to set this as the entry for the attribute.  When specified
like so, the top of the HEAD of the default branch will be used:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-10}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

# Short-hand syntax
unikraft: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git

# Long-hand syntax
unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
```

Alternatively, a specific tag, branch or Git SHA can be specified by setting:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-11,13-14,16-19,21-22,24-27}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

# Short-hand syntax for a specific branch
unikraft: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git@staging

# Long-hand syntax for a specific branch
unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: staging

# Short-hand syntax for a specific tag
unikraft: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git@RELEASE-0.14.0

# Long-hand syntax for a specific ta
unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: RELEASE-0.14.0

# Short-hand syntax for a specific commit
unikraft: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git@70bc0af

# Long-hand syntax for a specific commit
unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: 70bc0af0bd1c74b3af3c0584d7b7373dc42b2ce7
```

It is possible to access remote repositories which requires authentication over
SSH, simply set this as part of the scheme:

```yaml ln={5-7,9-13}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

# Short-hand syntax for specifying an authenticated Git repository over SSH,
# which will select the default branch
unikraft: ssh://git@github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git

# Long-hand syntax for specifying an authenticated Git repository over SSH, and
# specifying a specific branch (or tag)
unikraft:
  source: ssh://git@github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: staging
```

<Info>
To use Git authentication over SSH, you must start an SSH agent before invoking
`kraft`, for example:
```shell
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
</Info>

Finally, it is possible to set the location of Unikraft's core to a path on the
host.  This is useful when you are hacking at the core directly or working
whilst traveling and do not have access to an internet connection:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-11}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

# Short-hand sytnax for a specific path on disk
unikraft: path/to/unikraft

# Long-hand syntax for a specific path on disk
unikraft:
  source: path/to/unikraft
```

### Specifying KConfig configuration

To declare any specific options from Unikraft's configuration system, you must
always use the long-hand syntax.  All KConfig options start with `CONFIG_` and
can be set in either list format with key and value delimetered with an equal
(`=`) symbol or in map format:

```yaml ln={5-8,10-13}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

# Using list-style formatting
unikraft:
  kconfig:
  - CONFIG_EXAMPLE=y

# Using map-style formatting
unikraft:
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_EXAMPLE: "y"
```

### A more complex example

All three sub-attributes, `source`, `version` and `kconfig`, can be used
together to generate a very specific definition of the Unikraft core:

```yaml ln={5-9}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: stable
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_EXAMPLE: "y"
```

## Top-level `libraries` attributes

Additional third-party libraries CAN be specified as part of the build and are
listed in map-format.  Similar to the `unikraft` attribute, each library can
specify a `source`, `version` and a set of `kconfig` options, for example:

```yaml ln={8-9,11-26}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

unikraft: stable

libraries:
  # Short-hand syntax for specifying the library "musl" on the stable channel
  musl: stable

  # Long-hand syntax for specifying a library at a specified source, using a
  # specific Git branch, and specifying additional KConfig options
  lwip:
    source: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-lwip.git
    version: stable
    kconfig:
      CONFIG_LWIP_AUTOIFACE: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_DHCP: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_DNS: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_IPV4: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_SOCKET: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_KEEPALIVE: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_TCP: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_THREADS: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_UKNETDEV: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_WND_SCALE: "y"
```

In the above example, two additional libraries are used,
[`musl`](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl) and
[`lwip`](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-lwip).  The names of these libraries
are determined by what is [sourced via `kraft`'s package
manager](/docs/cli/packaging#listing-and-searching-for-packages).

## Top-level `targets` attributes

A target is defined as a specific destination that the resulting unikernel is
destined for and consists at minimum of a specific platform (e.g. `qemu` or
`firecracker`) and architecture (e.g. `x86_64` or `arm64`) tuple.  A project can
have multiple targets depending on use case but MUST have at least one. 

Each target consists of at minimum an architecture and platform combination,
therefore a project with two targets of `qemu/x86_64` and `xen/arm64`:

```yaml ln={8-9,11-12}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

unikraft: stable

targets:
- platform: qemu
  architecture: x86_64

- platform: xen
  architecture: arm64
```

When left without any flags, `kraft build` will prompt you for the intended
target to build.

It is possible to define targets simply based on different runtime properties or
requirements.  This is possible by setting both a `name` sub-attribute and a set
of `kconfig` options, for example the following two targets both target
`qemu/x86_64` platform/architecture tuple but initialize the rootfs either based
on 9pfs or initrd, respectively:


```yaml ln={8-15,17-24}
specification: v0.5

name: helloworld

unikraft: stable

targets:
- name: helloworld-qemu-x86_64-9pfs
  platform: qemu
  architecture: x86_64
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_ROOTFS: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS_9PFS: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS: "9pfs"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTDEV: "fs0"

- name: helloworld-qemu-x86_64-initrd
  platform: qemu
  architecture: x86_64
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_ROOTFS: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS_INITRD: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS: "initrd"
```
