title: Building KraftKit from source
description:
  The Unikraft companion command-line tool `kraft` is developed via the 
  KraftKit project which is a general-purpose, Go-based SDK for building 
  Unikraft unikernels programmatically.  Learn how to use this framework and
  build the `kraft` binary.
---

The [KraftKit](https://kraftkit.sh) is an open-source, `BSD-3-Clause` licensed
sub-project of Unikraft and is designed as a general-purpose, Go-based SDK which
is used to deliver the `kraft` binary as well as a number of additional tools
which are used for managing unikernels based on Unikraft.

To get started building `kraft` from source, start by simply cloning the
repository with Git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit.git
```

Then `cd` into the repository:

```shell
cd kraftkit/
```

KraftKit uses [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to simplify
building specific targets and includes a top-level help menu that can be used to
reference developer-specific actions:

```shell
make help
```
```txt nocopy=true
KraftKit developer build targets.

<Warning>
We recommend using one of the available [developer
environments](#using-a-developer-environment) to get started.  If you do not
wish to use this environment and wish to use the `go` toolchain which is native
to your host, unset the `DOCKER` environmental variable before continuing:
```shell
export DOCKER=
```
Without setting this, relevant `make` targets will be proxied via `docker`.
Note that if you have an alternative container runtime system such as
[containerd](https://containerd.io/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) and wish to
use this proxy, set the `DOCKER` environmental variable to the relevant tool,
for example:
```shell
# For containerd
export DOCKER=nerdctl

# For Podman
export DOCKER=podman 
```
</Warning>


## Using a developer environment

To build `kraft` without having to manage additional build dependencies on your
host you can use one of two available developer environments.


### GitHub Codespace

Get started quickly and easily by using [GitHub
Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) which will include a
prepared environment for both hacking KraftKit's source code which is written in
Go as well as running Unikraft unikernels in [emulation mode](#) for testing
purposes:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/unikraft/kraftkit)


### Local Docker/container environment

For local development, it is possible to access a pre-built developer
environment container image which includes all the necessary tools and libraries
for building `kraft`.  You can pre-fetch this image by calling:

```shell
docker pull kraftkit.sh/myself-full:latest
```

Or you can build this locally by calling:

```shell
make buildenv-myself-full
```

Once you have the `myself-full` image stored locally, you can spawn an ephemeral
build environment which will map the KraftKit codebase into the path
`/workspace`, simply invoke:

```shell
make devenv
```

The above command will drop you into a new shell where you can access the same
`make` commands and work on changes which are immediately reflected on your host
to the container build environment.  To quit this environment from the shell,
type <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>+<Kbd>D</Kbd> or type `exit`.

## Building the `kraft` binary

To build the `kraft` binary you must have at least Go 1.20 installed on your
host.  You can find [relevant installation instructions for the Go toolchain
here](https://go.dev/doc/install).  Once installed, simply call:

```shell
make kraft
```

This will generate a binary image within the directory `dist/`.

<Info>
Within a developer environment, the `kraft` binary within the `dist/` folder
will already be placed within the globally accessible `PATH`.  Outside of this
environment, you can access this binary either by calling it directly or by
adding it your path like so:
```shell
export PATH=$(pwd)/dist:$PATH
```
</Info>


## Preparation for submitting pull requests

We welcome contributions! Before continuing, please read through our
[contribution guidelines](#) and our [community code of conduct](#).  Before
creating a PR we recommend the following in preparation which will check new
additions with our linting requirements:

```shell
make cicheck
```

As well as all test suites to prevent any regressions:

```shell
make test
```
