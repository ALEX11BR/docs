title: "Efficiency"
description: |
  In addition to being highly performant, it has been demonstrated that 
  Unikraft consumes less power than typical monolithic (traditional) Operating 
  Systems such as Linux.

As a proof of concept, we have ported Unikraft to the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and the
Xilinx Ultra96-V2 devices. We compare Unikraft with off-the-shelf Alpine Linux
and Raspbian OS as well as a specialized, stripped down Raspbian (removing
non-essential build tools, system packages and docs).

We evaluate power consumption versus Linux when idle and when running a
CPU-intensive calculation of π (see figure below); as shown, Unikraft can
provide important power reduction in both scenarios in comparison to Linux
(running only on a single core and with networking modules disabled, for fair
comparison).

Note that while these tests were run on small ARM devices, the
efficiency gains would also translate to power reduction on larger
devices such as servers.
