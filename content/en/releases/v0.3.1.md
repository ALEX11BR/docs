This release is a bugfix that adds support for newlib back to
Unikraft. Due to changes in unikraft's vfscore library, newlib did not
properly compile against v0.3. This release fixes this problem.

All xenbits-hosted unikraft repositories (unikraft, newlib, lwip, as
well as the example applications helloworld and httpreply) at
`RELEASE-0.3.1` tag are compatible with each other and can be built and
linked together again.
